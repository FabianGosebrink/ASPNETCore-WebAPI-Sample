# ASP.NET Core WebApi Sample with HATEOAS, Versioning & Swagger

In this repository I want to give a plain starting point at how to build a WebAPI with ASP.NET Core.

This repository contains a controller which is dealing with FoodItems. You can GET/POST/PUT/PATCH and DELETE them.

Hope this helps..

See the examples here:
